## Evaluation 📝

This project was developed as part of an interview challenge for Iriscube Reply. The entire project, from conception to completion, was carried out over a span of 6 days.

Despite my efforts to reach out for feedback, I have not received any response from the company regarding scheduling a meeting for code reviews. However, I believe in the value of every learning experience.

Please note that the absence of feedback is not a reflection on the quality of the project, as the company has not viewed the code.
